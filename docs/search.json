    "text": "1 Introduction\nAs international students, we are more concerned with whether our flights can get us to our destination on time, especially when we have a connecting flight. If the previous flight is delay, we may miss the next flight and the whole flight plan will be disrupted. This leads to stress and unnecessarily additional costs. That is why we choose to focus on the topic of flight delay problems in New York airports. This issue causes not only an inconvenience but also a significant barrier for people who rely heavily on flight time.\nWith that issue in mind, we raise a question: what factors cause one flight cannot depart on time? Because of weather conditions, season differences, different flight companies or etc.? Exploring this issue and figuring out the factors behind are important for travelers to understand how airport work to support each punctual flight, particularly for international students and those who face tight flight schedules.",

Our flight dataset is filtered to include flights originating or arriving in New York during August and December 2023. Correspondingly, the weather dataset covers the year 2023, with months filtered later for analysis. We chose August and December because they represent two distinct seasons with significant weather differences. These months often experience extreme weather conditions, such as heavy rain or snow, making them ideal for exploring the impact of weather on flight delays. The datasets are structured on a daily frequency. This means that while the weather data is collected daily, our analysis focuses only on the date of each flight, without considering specific hours. Key columns in the datasets include “icon” in the weather dataset, which indicates conditions like rain, snow, or cloudy skies, and “ARR_delay” in the flight dataset, which records the arrival delay in minutes (e.g., “-26,” “13,” or “0”). Each row in the flight dataset corresponds to information about a specific flight, while each row in the weather dataset represents the weather conditions for a particular day. To process the data, we extracted it into .csv files and imported them using the read_csv function for further analysis.",

However, the WEATHER_DELAY column has approximately 80% missing values. This could be due to two main reasons: first, in practice, flight delays are often caused by air traffic control rather than weather conditions. Second, it is highly likely that most days in a month experience good weather, meaning only about 20% of flight delays are due to severe weather conditions.\nInterestingly, this fact of missing value adds more depth and possibilities to our research and exploration. The missing values in the WEATHER_DELAY column are not meaningless; rather, they indicate whether a delay was weather-related. This information allows us to better focus on understanding the impact of weather on flight delays, which aligns closely with our goals.\n\n\nCode\nmissing_summary &lt;- colSums(is.na(data_weather))\nprint(\"Missing Values per Column:\")\n\n\n[1] \"Missing Values per Column:\"\n\n\nCode\nprint(missing_summary)\n\n\n            name         datetime          tempmax          tempmin \n               0                0                0                0 \n            temp     feelslikemax     feelslikemin        feelslike \n               0                0                0                0 \n             dew         humidity           precip       precipprob \n               0                0                0                0 \n     precipcover       preciptype             snow        snowdepth \n               0                0                0                0 \n        windgust        windspeed          winddir sealevelpressure \n               0                0                0                0 \n      cloudcover       visibility   solarradiation      solarenergy \n               0                0                0                0 \n         uvindex       severerisk          sunrise           sunset \n               0                0                0                0 \n       moonphase       conditions      description             icon \n               0                0                0                0 \n        stations \n               0 \n\n\nCode\ntotal_missing &lt;- sum(is.na(data_weather))\ncat(\"\\nTotal Missing Values in Dataset:\", total_missing, \"\\n\")\n\n\n\nTotal Missing Values in Dataset: 0 \n\n\nCode\nvis_miss(data_weather)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no missing value in “data_weather” dataset, so we don’t need to handle the missing value problem for this dataset.",
